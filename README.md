Sign Language Detection using Deep Learning & MediaPipe

This project is a real-time Sign Language Detection System built using TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.
It uses a trained LSTM deep learning model to recognize hand gestures from webcam input and display the predicted sign with confidence scores.
